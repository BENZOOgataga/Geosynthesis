## ⚙️ Configuration

All game parameters can be modified in:
- `/public/mockdata/state.json` - Initial world state
- `/public/mockdata/tech_tree.json` - Technologies
- `/src/lib/worldgen.ts` - World generation constants
- `/src/lib/economy.ts` - Economic parameters
- `/src/lib/ai.ts` - AI behavior weights

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **TypeScript IDE errors** - These clear when dev server compiles
2. **Mobile layout** - Optimized for desktop first
3. **LocalStorage limit** - Can fill up after many saves
4. **No undo** - Actions are permanent

See [BUGS.md](BUGS.md) for complete issue tracking.

## 🎓 Learning Resources

### Understanding the Code
1. Start with `App.tsx` - Main game loop
2. Review `worldgen.ts` - Data structures
3. Explore `economy.ts` - Simulation logic
4. Check `MapView.tsx` - SVG rendering

### Modifying the Game
1. Add resources: Update `Resources` interface
2. Add tech: Edit `tech_tree.json`
3. Modify AI: Adjust weights in `ai.ts`
4. Change theme: Edit CSS variables in `theme.css`
